    "\n",
    "However, the examples we look at in the exercise should (hopefully) be fairly self-explanatory. In the example below, we describe the network structure in PyTorch. This network consists of only a single linear layer with only one node, the activation function is the identity. We also specify that we want to use the mean squared error as the loss function and the Adam optimizer as the optimizer. \n",
    "   \n",
    "To define a neural network, we now need to write a class that inherits from the `torch.Module` class. We have to provide an `__init__()` and `forward()` method. In the `__init__()` method, we define the structure of our neural network. The `forward()` method defines how the so-called forward pass is calculated for our neural network (i.e. how the NN maps the input to the output).    \n",
